# One line script for biebering your friends

Has a 1/16 probability of parroting them when they ls.

If you trust me (and you shouldn't) use this one line to automatically set up the prank:

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glentakahashi/parrot-bieber/master/bieber.sh | sh`

### todo

* add conditionals for os + arch
